Docker Networking allows you to create a
Network of Docker Containers managed
by a master node called the manager.
Containers inside the Docker Network can
talk to each other by sharing packets of information.
In this article, we will discuss some basic commands
that would help you get started with Docker Networking.
Docker Networking
A network is a group of two or more devices
that can communicate with each other
either physically or virtually.
The Docker network is a virtual network
created by Docker to enable communication
between Docker containers.
If two containers are running on the same host
they can communicate with each other
without the need for ports to be exposed
to the host machine.
You may use Docker to manage your Docker hosts
in any platform manner,
regardless of whether they run Windows,
Linux, or a combination of the two.
